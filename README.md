This is the code repository for [Learning MongoDB 4 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/data/learning-mongodb-4-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
When it comes to managing a heavy volume of unstructured and non-relational datasets, MongoDB has become the de facto database management system for DBAs and data architects.
This video teaches all you need to know about building a MongoDB database application with hands-on knowledge of every aspect of MongoDB 4.0 such as indexes, objectives, data modeling, authentication, relationships, expressions, replication, and more. This course will help you design and implement, and then monitor and secure, MongoDB database systems. With real-world examples, you will gain confidence in working with indexes, queries, and regular database operations. You also will master techniques such as aggregation, text searching, custom aggregations, and reporting.
By the end of the course, and after getting hands-on with all its latest features, you will be completely familiar with MongoDB 4.0.
